##  What is AI Ticketing Automation?

**AI Ticketing Automation** refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically manage, triage, and resolve support tickets in customer service or IT service management (ITSM) environments. Instead of relying solely on human agents to read, categorize, assign, and respond to tickets, AI handles many of these tasks‚Äîdramatically improving response times, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction.

## üîç Key Capabilities of AI Ticketing Automation

- **Auto-Triage and Categorization**  
  AI reads incoming tickets, detects intent, and automatically tags and categorizes them (e.g., billing issue, password reset).

- **Intelligent Routing**  
  Based on ticket content, urgency, or customer history, AI routes tickets to the right agent or department.

- **Automated Resolution (Autonomous Tickets)**  
  For repetitive or common issues (e.g., ‚Äúreset my password‚Äù), AI can instantly resolve the ticket using workflows, LLMs, or predefined knowledge.

- **Agent Assist**  
  AI surfaces suggested responses, previous related tickets, or documentation while the agent is replying‚Äîspeeding up resolution.

- **Sentiment and Priority Detection**  
  AI detects customer sentiment (e.g., frustrated, angry) and urgency to prioritize tickets more effectively.

- **Learning from Interactions**  
  Some advanced tools (like **Twig**) continuously learn from past resolutions to improve automation accuracy over time.
